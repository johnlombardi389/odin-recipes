  <p>In Seattle's International District, Liana Cafe House sells traditional Chinese pork dumplings from a tiny takeout shop. See how to make them at home.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped Chinese chives</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chile-garlic sauce (such as Sriracha®)</li>
    <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped Chinese chives</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>1½ tablespoons sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
    <li>50 dumpling wrappers</li>
    <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>1 quart water, or more as needed</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Combine 1/2 cup soy sauce, rice vinegar, 1 tablespoon chives, sesame seeds, and chile sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Mix pork, garlic, egg, 2 tablespoons chives, soy sauce, sesame oil, and ginger in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon about 1 tablespoon of the filling in the middle. Wet the edge with a little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the dumpling. Repeat with remaining dumpling wrappers and filling.</li>
    <li>Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place 8 to 10 dumplings in the pan and cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. Pour in 1 cup of water, cover and cook until the dumplings are tender and the pork is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Repeat for remaining dumplings. Serve with soy sauce mixture for dipping.</li>
  </ol>
