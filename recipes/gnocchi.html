  <h2>Description</h2>
  
  <p>A new and yummy twist to Gnocchi. Pair this up with butter or your favorite alfredo sauce. This recipe can be made with butternut squash instead of the sweet potatoes.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>2 (8 ounce) sweet potatoes</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, pressed</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    <li>1 egg </li>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake sweet potatoes for 30 minutes, or until soft to the touch. Remove from the oven, and set aside to cool.</li>
    <li>Once the potatoes are cool enough to work with, remove the peels, and mash them, or press them through a ricer into a large bowl. Blend in the garlic, salt, nutmeg, and egg. Mix in the flour a little at a time until you have soft dough. Use more or less flour as needed.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. While you wait for the water, make the gnocchi. On a floured surface, roll the dough out in several long snakes, and cut into 1-inch sections. Drop the pieces into the boiling water, and allow them to cook until they float to the surface. Remove the floating pieces with a slotted spoon, and keep warm in a serving dish. Serve with butter or cream sauce.</li>
